            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>This is a Unity implementation of Craig Reynold's <a href="http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~dt/siggraph97-course/cwr87/" style="font-size: 14pt; font-weight: 400;">Boids</a> algorithm. Essentially, the system is formed of several "boid" agents which react dynamically to each other and to the environment in a manner similar to a flock of birds or a school of fish. This implementation also includes "affectors", which add forces to boids within their range, and cursor following, which causes boids to follow a 3D cursor in the game world.</p>
        </div>
    
        <div id="project-features">
            <h2>Features</h2>
            <h3>Reaction to other boids</h3>
            <p>Each boid attempts to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Stay a certain distance from other boids</li>
                <li>Match velocity with that of nearby boids</li>
                <li>Move towards the centre of nearby boids</li>
            </ul>
            <br/>
            <h3>Boid affectors</h3>
            <p>Affectors are objects placed in the scene which influence the movement of a boid which enters its range. There are currently three types of affectors:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Attractor - pulls boids within its range into its centre</li>
                <li>Repulsor - repels boids that come within its range</li>
                <li>Pusher - pushes boids that come within its range in a predefined direction</li>
            </ul>
            <br/>
            <h3>Cursor follow</h3>
            <p>Boids may be set to follow a 3D target. In the demo, this is controlled by the player's mouse position.</p>
        </div>
    
        <div id="project-implementation">
            <h2>Implementation</h2>
            <h3>GPU flocking</h3>
            <p>The boids' flocking behaviour is implemented using compute shaders; this allows the behaviour of many boids to be calculated in parallel, and provides a significant performance increase over a typical CPU-based implementation.</p>
            <br/>
            <h3>Batched flocking</h3>
            <p>This is a variant of the basic GPU flocking which divides the flock into batches of boids and executes each batch on consecutive frames; thus, the entire flock is updated over n frames, where n is the number of batches the flock is divided into. With large flocks, and when the number of batches is kept small (&lt;8 frames is good) this method provides a great performance boost with no discernible impact to boid behaviour.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div id="project-performance">
            <h2>Performance</h2>
            <p>In informal testing, using an Nvidia RTX 2060 GPU, this implementation achieves around 60 frames per second on a flock of ~30000 boids without batching, and around 100 frames per second with batching over 4 frames.</p>
